/**
 * The Window Mover
 *
 * <p>
 *     This class when added as a mouse listener and mouse motion listener to a JFrame
 *     will move it when the user will click on it.
 * </p>
 *
 * To add it :
 *
 * <code>
 *     WindowMover mover = new WindowMover(frame);
 *     frame.addMouseListener(mover);
 *     frame.addMouseMotionListener(mover);
 * </code>
 *
 * For the listeners, you can replace frame by an object that will 'move the window'
